# Lets-Brunch-ATL-

This is the front end of my project Lets-Brunch-Atl-. My project is about my top three brunch restaurants in Atlanta. Brunch is right after breakfast but before lunch. That's how you have Brunch. 
With me being a wife and mom of two, brunch is great way for me to hang out with my friends and be home before the afternoon.

# Dependencies

I didn't use any dependencies for the front-end.

# Planning Documentation

I tried my best to stay with the wireframe that I came up with in my Google Slides. I used Google Slides as part of my planning process.
