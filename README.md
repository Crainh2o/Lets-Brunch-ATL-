# Lets-Brunch-ATL-

This is the front end of my project Lets-Brunch-Atl-. My project is about my top three brunch restaurants in Atlanta. Its a Blog of my favorite brunch place. Brunch is right after breakfast but before lunch. That's how you have Brunch. With me being a wife and mom of two, brunch is great way for me to hang out with my friends and be home before the afternoon.

I tried my best to stay with the wireframe that I came up with in my Google Slides. I used Google Slides as part of my planning process.

# General Approach

The approach I took for the project was to do a project that I would enjoy. I love brunch and I love posting about the different brunch places I go to. I chose my top three becasue I wanted to keep my project simple with the KISS and DRY principals.  


# Hurdles and Wins

The hurdles I faced were getting the go to menu button actually working and going to the menu. I had it working at first and when I started coding more the button didn't work anymore. If you click the button it will go to the different brunch id's but it doesn't go to the menu for the brunch place. A win is completin this project. I'm a beginnner software enginner, never coded in my life until I started this cohert with Gerneral Assembly. I have came a long way and looking forward to gaining more knowledge.
